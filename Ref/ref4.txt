2 topics:
=======
1) etaxchn module in Test server (only testsub1) 

2) epayslip module Priya Katam,  test server it was not working...
troubleshoot...


2) war file deployment:
===============================
epayslip.war supplied by SWD team, 2 versions of war file...
- uatsub1 
- uatsub3

war file deployment project ==> status: in-progress on testing server (UAT).

- Production server
- UAT server (pre-production) === war file deployment  for some modules ONLY... not ALL modules...
- BLR testing server (testsub1, testsub3..)

uatsub2 === einstruction== 

Andy & Sutrisno's requirement:   before we can proceed to go live,  need to ensure war file deployment to be error-free.

ground-base  that procedure is following strictly.... so assurity can be achieved


1) SWD will supply war file
2) OktaRack team will upload this war file to Designated server...
- clear tomcat/work/epayslip/ directory before NEW war file deploy...
- upload war file....
- restart tomcat twice..... first restart, it builds from war file, and extract...
    second restart, is for tomcat to compile and run....
