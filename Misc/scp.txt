See also a reconnecttime option below. 
Value abort is like on. In addition, the script is aborted, when any script command fails or any choice prompt is replied with “Abort” answer (or similar). 

When set to continue any choice prompt is automatically replied with “Skip”, “Ignore” or similar answer. 
Enabling batch mode sets reconnect time (reconnecttime option below) to 120 seconds, if it is not set yet.
